Either all human heads were shoved inside a metal box or a metal box grew around all human heads, covering every aperture of the face except the eyes. There were exactly two holes in the box, precisely drilled in front of the two eyes when worn; the size of the hole only big enough to see the road but not the beautiful meadows that it is encased in. The chill air that carried the sound of the universe crept in through the same holes and reached the human ears; the size of the hole only big enough to allow the sound inside but not the songs. The holes were bigger for the bigger eyes. Every box was different; different for the different heads.

I had observed the maturation of my child from the eyes of a tree that carefully watches the ripening of its first fruit. And from what I observed as a father, I refuse to believe that the metal box grew around all humans. In fact, every man, himself, deliberately and cautiously shoved his head inside the box. Indeed, it gave him pleasure; a pleasure that you feel when you abandon a curious questioning child whose questions and curiosities tire you; a pleasure that you feel when you encounter a narrow alley after walking in a long, wide road whose ends couldn’t fit inside your eyes; a pleasure of confinement; a pleasure of suffocation; a pleasure of limits and boundaries.

When his head emerged from his mother’s womb, it was unconfined and unbound by the metal box, unlike most human heads floating in the streets. I ran my hands around his head. He moved his head and there was no clanking sound from the metal box that quivered the air and silenced the words of everything else. He observed and associated with everything. He heard and sang with everything. He dissolved in the solution of everything as a grain of salt in water. He lay on the cold grass of the meadow and wrote about the moonlight. Now, with a metal box around his head, he still writes about moonlight but his realization of his failure to reach the moon overflows in his ink.

One night, when the trees fell, when the birds left, and when the sky’s curtain closed, he buried himself in his room. He didn’t come outside for several days. When I broke down his door, I saw him fabricating a metal box, and just before I ran to rescue him, he shoved his head inside the box. At that very moment, I witnessed several deaths. I heard the sound of their last cry. I saw the death of childhood, of freedom that God had provided him, and of the endlessness of himself. I also witnessed one sparkling birth; it was the birth of the box of ‘identity’ that was to linger around his head until his death.
