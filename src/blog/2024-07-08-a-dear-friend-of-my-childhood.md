His country resides in his skull and a military coup is rising. His father's dead but the black imprint of his hands on his mother's cheek still breathes a little, smelling of alcohol and cigarettes'. Our families know each other and so do our inadequacies. Every time when his home smelled of his father's sweat, alcohol, dying cigarette smoke, and incomplete screams, someone needed run up to his home in the middle of the night to separate that toothlessly grinning bony hand off her mother's neck. Most of the time it was my father, but not that night when one conflict ended and another began; the night his father killed himself after starting another round of domestic violence. He is a dear friend of my childhood and we live nearby.



Flowers on the yard of a home where domestic violence gouges every night rarely bloom. One such flower is my friend, Aayush. Every night his drunk father screamed at him, his mother, and dead stars, he sowed seeds of great conflict in Aayush's mind. He blames himself for his father's suicide; after he shaved his head for his father's funeral, saw his dead body turn into ashes, he remembered he wasn't always a bad father. He remembered the time his father woke up early, even before his mother, and made a delicious meal of rice and chicken for the family. He was surprised at himself that he could remember his smile. He held on to that nicotine-coated, blackened smile forming in his mind to check if everything of that smile belonged only, and only to his father. The smoke of the fire burning his dead body hurt Aayush's eye and brought out a tear; yes, everything of that smile belonged only to his father. Nothing of his mother's smile, or his own had filled the gap. There was no gap. Two divergent viewpoints quarrels in his mind. One views his father's death as a relief, as an anchor of her mother's joyful future and freedom. For another, his father's dead body reminds him of his own shortcomings as a son and a guilt guts his heart; there is no relief in his death. 



I can't remember how many times I've uttered these exact words to Aayush during our meetings: "Your father wasn't a good man. He was an alcoholic and he beat your mother. You can't blame yourself for his suicide." I also can't remember how many times he has uttered these exact words to me: "But maybe I could've helped him. I could've talked to him, instead of killing him thousand times in my mind." I realized my words of consolation were meaningless as it were likely uttered by countless other people in his life. As I walked down the road after we departed, I thought of another way through which I could help him. I advised him to simply observe his mother. Observe everything about her. After his father died, is there any new scar on her face? Does she still gaze at the door shivering with fear every time the sun goes down and working men arrive home? I told him, "Just look at her today, won't you sense a kind of tranquility in her movements, in her sleep? Make her laugh, won't her laughter be unrestrained and carefree? Every time the same recurring thought of guilt arrives in your mind, think of your mother. You don't even need to ask her about it, just by looking at her, you'll know, won't you?" He simply nodded his head and almost with a faint smile, told me that he has started taking pills for OCD.



While I may not be able to erase the scars of his past, my role is to be a constant source of support and understanding. Aayush's decision to seek professional help for his OCD shows his courage and commitment to healing. Witnessing his strength gives me hope that even in the face of immense trauma, growth and recovery are possible. This experience has instilled in me the importance of open communication and empathy within my own relationships. By fostering a safe and supportive environment, I hope to prevent similar conflicts from taking root.
