The tree was full of shame. The flowers had turned out white, and the night was watching. Though the night never spoke ill of its flowers, the tree could see that the night’s wind, unlike the day’s, was filled with anger by the time it reached its leaves; the wind, on its way, borrowed thorns from the roses. Why punish its leaves, for the whiteness of its flowers? The flowers, on the other hand, were oblivious to the night’s stare. They could find bliss in their own beauty which was only enhanced by the night’s darkness; if only the tree carried the white flowers without shame, the flowers could unfurl their fragrance freely, compelling the moon to cast aside the clouds, the slaves of the night’s wind, and reveal itself with all its brilliance, just to smell. With the white moon, the white-flower tree could stand before the night with pride. But for the tree, the flowers were a burden. Fortunately, I was sitting below the umbrella of its branches and wasn’t so absent in my own thoughts that I heard the tree cry and ask for a favor.

While I painted the flowers black, I asked no questions to the tree, though there were many in my head. I didn’t ask because I felt that I already knew the answers.



Why can’t you see beauty in your flowers? Perhaps you can see their beauty which is why you’re filled with shame. The night’s dark, how could you stand before it without shame, with all your flowers blooming white?



Why are you afraid of the night? Perhaps you’re afraid of your flowers, and not the night. You know the night’s dead.



You should wait. Won’t the moon come tomorrow? Perhaps you would rather merge your darkness into the night, the night that, though dead, is always there, than wait for the moon to merge your flowery brightness, the moon that, though living, hides itself behind the clouds.



By the time I thought of these answers, I realized that I had painted most of the flowers black. Only a handful of 4 or 5 of them were left. Only a few shame, only a few burdens, only a few dissenters of the dark. The petals were in pain but the leaves were happy. The tree was quiet.



I blackened another flower. The tree was still quiet, but its branches moved windlessly.



Unlike the night, the day paid no attention to the white flowers. The tree often felt the weight of the flowers melting away. In fact, it was in the eyes that the flowers melted away to. The sun sapped the moisture from the flowers, leaving their white petals bleached and brittle. In the eyes of the tree, a pond resided. The white flowers quietly sneaked their way into the pond, bathe in its still water, and turned the sun into a giant bee. Seeing the sun shaped like a bee, the tree felt good about its white flowers, even grateful. The illusion of the flowers it carried was so great that the tree held its breath, waiting for the sun bee to descend and sip the nectar of its phantom flowers.



I blackened another flower —



“Stop.” The tree cried. I heard.



The illusion that invasion of the flowers in its eyes created didn’t stop at the sun turning into a bee. The tree saw humans inhaling the air it exhaled, its branches giving shade to the pedestrians. When darkness fell, the tree felt ashamed. It wished its flowers hadn’t fooled it so badly. The tree cursed its flowers; they had made the tree think its life had a purpose.



I blackened another flower —



“Please stop. Don’t do it. Don’t make them dark. I’m sorry.” The tree cried again.



I blackened another flower.



When I stopped, I realized that what I was doing was so pleasurable that I needed to do it again. The act released all my burdens, as if I was blackening my own flowers. I needed to blacken another flower, but there were none left. The flowers were gone, not only the flowers, but the tree too.



I killed another white-flower tree.
