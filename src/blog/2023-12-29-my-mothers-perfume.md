I saw an Orchid

Sneak into the bedroom

And steal my mother’s

Newly-bought perfume.





She blushed

Then cried at a fading red truth

As she sprinkled a few drops

Onto her departing youth.





She went to the garden

By the back door

With a French Orchid Spray Perfume

Bought from an old cosmetic store





“Is it new?”

“Whose flavor?”

“Didn’t she have a rose one? I smell like an Orchid!”

An old rose muttered,

Wearing the perfume she gave her.





“For me, too”

Cried a lavender

“Oh, you’re young!

Don’t give it to her!”

A magnolia grabbed the perfume

And whimpered.

Then she bathed in its fragrance

To smell once again

Like a Love to a kingbird
