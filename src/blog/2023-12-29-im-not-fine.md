I should have never let her ask me how I was. Now the last bit of gold in my tongue is tarnished.



Never, never should I have forgotten to greet her with ‘I’m fine’ and ask her how she was before she could ask me to elaborate. Mother, I’m sorry I lied and I’m sorry I no longer have a golden tongue.



With golden tongues, old men had built a world of truth. Gold was the truth, the only truth. Our fathers carefully plated our tongues with gold before we could speak. They taught us to slowly form words, roll the words in our tongues in a way they become coated with gold, and, making sure they don’t touch the dust particles flying in the air, put them cautiously in other people’s tongues. In this way, we were taught to speak. Until I became 15, my tongue was as golden as my mother’s jewelry. After 15, my gold started to tarnish as I began to lie with ‘I’m fine’. People had started to ask me how I was.



“How are you?” Aarush asked me as we shook our hands. My gold tarnished. My brother, after returning from America after a decade, patted me on my shoulder and asked me the question that tarnished my gold. My uncle asked me twice, my gold tarnished twice. I still had enough gold in my tongue to be able to answer truthfully any other questions that didn’t ask me about my well-being. But the tarnished gold meant I couldn’t tell the truth to myself, ever again.



Once, when I was still learning to acquire the taste of a food eaten with a golden tongue, I cursed the old men who plated their tongue with gold and I cursed my father who plated my tongue with gold. I was crying when he told me, “Listen, son. This gold coated in your tongue is much more valuable than the one still lying by the river. Having a golden tongue means being truthful to others at all times. And most importantly, being truthful to yourself. If you lie, your gold will tarnish. Once your gold becomes dirty, you’ll never be able to talk to yourself truthfully.”



“Would you plate my tongue with gold again?”, I shall ask my father. If I cry and resist, he must beat me again, incapacitate my jaw, pull out my tongue from a demolished cave, hang my tongue from a cathode bar, lower the bar in a plating tank, and immerse my tongue until it gets plated and hang it until it dries and finally, if it’s necessary, repeat. This way, only truth will come out of my tongue (if I don’t resist the truth so powerfully that I’ll vomit and lie, as I do every time someone asks me how I am).



I couldn’t ask my father to do it for me. It would mean going back to the graveyard of my childhood, digging the ground, and placing its fragile body back on the earth. It doesn’t matter how beautiful or ugly my childhood was, it’s now a lie. While carving the truth in my tongue, my mind would be roaming around the lie. So, I left home and went to the banks of Gandaki where unknown, old gold miners would do the job for me.



“Would you plate my tongue with gold?”, I asked a middle-aged gold miner who sat by the river bank and looked sick when I saw his eyes. He laughed as if I said something ridiculously stupid. “I’ll give you money”, I formed these words in my tongue, rolled them in my tongue until they became coated with little gold I had left, and placed them in his tongue. Not a bit of gold was coated in his tongue. He stopped laughing but a faint smile remained.



“I would do it if you weren’t so desperate”, his voice sounded sicker than his eyes appeared.



“I don’t understand.”



“I can recognize a person who wants to speak the truth and nothing else. I won’t plate gold in your tongue and tell you that the words you speak will be true because they won’t. Truth isn’t in the words coated with gold. You don’t need gold to speak the truth. The truth lies in the flesh. Like you. Children are taught from the very beginning that they must have gold in their tongue to be able to speak the truth. But gold is merely a lie told by gold sellers which are our fathers.”



His voice sounded less sick as he spoke those words. I noticed something shining inside whenever he opened his mouth.



“What is that shining inside your mouth?”



He pulled out his tongue. There wasn’t a bit of gold in his tongue.



“The truth.” His tongue reflected the sunlight like gold. I had never seen a golden tongue reflecting the sunlight like his tongue.



I returned home after the conversation. The sunlight reflected from his tongue still warmed my eyes. This time, I was ready…ready to tell everyone how I was. So I went to my father and stood there until he asked me how I was. He didn’t. But my mother who saw me standing idly asked me, “What are you doing? How are you?”. I opened my mouth, the words formed in my mouth spontaneously like bubbles and, without coating them with gold, told her, “I’m not fine, mother. I haven’t been fine since I was 15. I’ve become extremely self-conscious and fearful. I’ve come to know that I’m not like others and I can’t fit in even if I try. Alone, I only think about people. With people, I only think about myself. I’m aware of how my face darkened and I abandoned all my mischief when I ran away from you and towards my father and a bike hit me and broke my bones when I was 6. I’m aware of how my eyes blink helplessly and shrink and my head lowers when I talk to people. I’m aware of how people expect me to be cheerful and talk smilingly with a loud, clear voice when they hear about me that I’m well-mannered obedient and studious. I’m aware of how I can’t quickly put words to my thoughts when I speak and properly complete a sentence without stopping for a breath. I’m aware of how I think I’m ugly and how I convince myself that people will like me once they get to know me and my talents. I’m aware of how I look myself in the mirror and pray that people won’t vomit after they see my face, that people won’t walk away from me once they see my unusually fat thighs and buttocks, that people won’t close their nose once they smell me and know that I stink, that people won’t curse when they see that it’s me who has ruined the group picture, that people won’t avoid looking at me when they see a chaotic mustache that is on my face because I’m too anxious about asking a barber to cut anything else than my hair and what people reading newspapers and waiting for their turn think of me…”



“…I’m aware of how, despite all this, I think I’m special and destined for greatness. I’m aware of how I think I’ll achieve greatness merely by lying in the corner of my room and writing. I’m aware of how I’m using artificial intelligence with no real, raw human emotions to tell me that my writing is moving and profound. I am aware that my self-love emerges from the culmination of my self-pity and self-hatred. Mother, I don’t know what’s the truth: my weaknesses or my insecurities, my awareness or my ignorance, my self-hatred or my self-love. So, I’m not fine, mother. I’m always killing myself and hoping that I find myself.”



I noticed my mother wasn’t there. Nor was my father. They were in the yard watering the plants. The sunlight struck my eyes as it came from the sun, got reflected by my tongue, and further got reflected by the mirror, hitting my eye.
