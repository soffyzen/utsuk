My mother burst into tears when her sister hugged her by the door. I watched her fearless arms slowly coiling around my mother and forming a small, special pond where she could spill all her tears, while I stood nearby, feeling nervous and regretful. Why didn’t I have arms as dutiful and fearless as hers? Why couldn’t I hug my mother? <i>I will…later. </i>

Although I had some combination of words that I could say to comfort her when she suddenly sobbed in the middle of the day, it wasn’t anything special or personal for any stranger could say the same to my mother without giving out the faintest breath of genuine care. <i> Although they were the same generic words of comfort, if uttered by her son, surely it should mean something to her. </i> 

She was in the most difficult phase of her life, and I was her son. I could have done better. Sometimes I pretended it wasn’t a very big deal and she wasn’t the only one.  <i> How could she expect me to suddenly express all the love that I have for her in this very moment when she isn’t even dying? </i>

I prayed to be sick on my stomach so I could vomit all my love for her right on her clothes, and she could examine the vomit as long as she wanted, to see if I had some disease. I told my sister, “If you see me crying in my room, bring her and make sure she sees the tears streaming down my cheeks before I wash my face.” 

<i> My sister didn’t actually cry. Why should I? She told me once, “When I need to cry, I just pick my nose. The tears come automatically.”</i> All my cousins had done it. My grandparents too. Even the bald uncle, who suffered from chronic dry eye, managed to produce tears in front of my mom. She saw the tear from every eye who she believed cared for her. 

If you can’t differentiate one person’s tears from the other, why should you differentiate the eyes? If I cried, my tears would be the same in color and taste as anyone else's.

Instead of crying, holding her hands, or hugging her, I wrote an angry poem. 

    "Cancer-"

    What an excuse to carry two bodies

              within one!

    I do fear the day-

      your body fades away

    and I, under-

       the thundering silence of your death,

    cry for more bodies of you.

    But-

      Cancer?

    I am not proud, mother.

    I am not relieved.


                  I wish these words didn't dance

    drunk on my tears

    I wish you had found another way

        that replicates your body

    which doesn't split apart your soul. 

I figured the perfect time to hug my mother would be when she returns home after her final chemotherapy. I’ll hug her just by the door. I didn’t need to cry and I didn’t need to smile either. I could just hug my mother. Every time the main gate creaked, my heart jolted awake and tried to run away from the authority of my pathetic, fearful mind. A triumphant sun rose over my family, and I felt afraid. My mother beat cancer and I was afraid. At the moment of celebration, I was afraid. The gate creaked again. My mother had returned home from the bazaar of death, having bought for herself, a brand-new life. 

I looked at myself in the mirror. I cried as if my mother had passed away. This time, I didn’t wish my mother could see this. I cried because…<i>what went wrong?</i> Why couldn’t my mother just know that I cared for her and cried and prayed for her wellbeing locking myself in the bathroom? I heard her voice. I felt her footsteps. I felt her relief. I also felt myself digging a hole in her heart. I need…need to embrace my mother. <i>I will…later</i>. The night came too early. I’ll hug her right before she goes to bed. Her bedtime came too early. I’ll hug her right after she wakes up. Morning also came too early. I went to her room. I wished her good morning. Then, I pretended to search for something and left the room. Later, she prepared a meal like she did before her diagnosis. The rice, dal, everything tasted exactly the same.  I’ll just write a new poem. The one that would describe my love for her...and I’ll read it to her. Yes, that would be a lot better than a hug. By the next morning, I wrote a poem. My voice would never do justice to my words. She should read it herself. I’ll just send it to her. I will…later. It would be a lot better than a loving, warm embrace. And instead of hoping that my poem expresses my love for her with just as emotion and clarity as a loving embrace would do, I hoped that she compliments me and assures me that I will become a good writer.  

I wish my mother had never had cancer. Even more strongly, I wish I had been a child when she had cancer so that I could embrace my mother with pure love and innocence every time I saw a drop of tear forming in her eyes, instead of getting away from her and writing a poem. 

     Dear mother, think of these words as my arms. 

    I wrap these words around you… 

     (I rest my head in your shoulder)

    …in a way they make a much larger pond under your eyes.

    (I hope you’ve left some tears to fill this pond, if you haven’t,

     I have a few). 

    Dear mother, think of these letters as my eyes. 

     I melt these letters before you…

    (I let the tears fall on the pond)

    …in a way the blackbirds hiding in these letters 

    Will fly and feed on the leeches and worms of the pond.

      (I hope the bluebirds in your eyes 

      will recognize my blackbirds) 

    Dear mother, think of this poem as my love. 

     I carve this poem on every object your eye touches… 

    (I call all the wild animals to come to the pond) 

    …in a way you’ll always know the poem by heart 

    And recite it every time I lock myself in my room. 

       (I hope all the animals will gather together 

     on the pond and quench their thirst of childhood)

The pond that could've formed, had I hugged my mother, would now be glistening in moonlight.

<h3> THE POND AND THE BLACKBIRD </h3>

Another blackbird had died of thirst. "I'll too die very soon, if the pond doesn't form", the only remaining blackbird said to himself. 

I met him the day my mother was diagnosed with cancer. Every night, he urged me to embrace my mother and tell her: "I'm here for you, nothing will happen to you." He pecked at my head whenever I left my mother. He pecked at my chest whenever I hesitated to talk to my mother. He pecked at my eyes whenever I cried, alone. "I'll keep pecking at you until you form the pond and let her spill her tears in your arms. It will hurt you", he said to me. "I'm going to die, I might as well kill you." 

"Why don't you drink my tears? End your pain right now?", I said to the blackbird. With my tears, I could quench the thirst of million blackbirds. "I wish I could. But only someone else's tears that falls in your pond can quench my thirst. Don't you think I could have drunk my own tears?"

"Oh, so if I somehow collect my mother's tears and pour them into my pond, you can drink it and that'll save your life?" I thought of the easy road. "You think that's easier than simply hugging your mother?", the blackbird asked. Yes, it is. I didn't respond. 

He continuously pecked at me every day. He had made a hole in my chest and had started to live there. Sometimes I wished for him to die. Both of our misery would end. I wondered about the source of his strength he possessed even when death was so near. I thought of borrowing some of the strengths for myself from the same source: strength to express my love, strength to say to my mother that I love her. 

My mother has recovered back to normal. The heaviness in my chest has become familiar, natural, as if it was gifted to me when I was a child. I sometimes wonder if it’s the ghost of the blackbird that's been living in my chest. I heard his last breath. He died right in my chest. I have no way of knowing for sure.
