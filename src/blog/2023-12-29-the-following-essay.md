I wondered if every drop of liquor sliding down my father's throat had reached his

hands that stirred, in the sudden gust of the night, to my mother's neck. As he

screamed at her, us, and the dead stars, I glanced at an opened computer case and

scattered computer parts, lying troubled in my room. When you have a vulnerable

family, you have the freedom that is reckless as the storm, the freedom that can leave

you naked as the trees in winter.



Later that night, I quietly sat on the floor, spilled a few tears, and tried to figure out how

to arrange the devices and sculpt a working computer. My vision was blurry. I touched

every part, the monitor, keyboard, UPS, mouse, CPU without knowing what to do with

them next. It was the day when I bought my first computer set. A far-off father and an

insecure mother, day upon day, helped me get lost in the world of computers where

codes danced on the screen and I danced along with them. Saving school lunch money

and buying a new OS for my computer provided me with more sense of security than

the few honest words with my father ever did.



My vulnerable family life propelled me to take several risks. The first risk I ever took, as

a child, was opening the CPU case and disassembling the parts of my newly-bought

computer on my birthday. I had access to computers very late in my life. My curiosity

was still raw. I disassembled the parts because I wanted to reassemble them on my

own. I wanted to check what was inside the large box that came along that ran the

computer. I gazed at the little pathways that ran across the motherboard. I touched the

processor, RAM, and expansion cards. I looked inside the CPU case with the eyes of a

hunter looking inside the case of buried treasures. The CPU laid open and the parts laid

bare but I was happy as summer trees.



But the day died and the night slowly poured the residues of yesterday. I lost the

processor. I couldn't reassemble the parts. I was unable to rework the computer. As my

mother cried that she had to borrow money to purchase the computer, my father

berated and blamed her for the waste of money. But I didn't regret what I did. It

embedded in me more seeds of passion for computer science.



My family's vulnerability slowly turned into a financial vulnerability. This pushed me to

reach out and expose myself for connections that I could find through my relative's and

friends' circles. I eventually started to meet and spend time with people with

backgrounds in computers. On one hand, I was carrying out small tasks of database

management and web development for a little pay, and on the other, I was learning

and understanding computer programs. I later realized that those youthful searches

weren't for money but different prospects and opportunities inside computer science. I

gained fresh experiences which I look forward to exploiting in my university years. A

few days after that night, I found the processor which had slipped below my closet. I

picked up the CPU, the parts that were thrown in the corner. A long night after, I rebuilt

the computer.



As I slowly grew in the field of computer science, I also, through the pangs and toils of

the years, learned a lot about vulnerable families. They resemble winter. As the winter

grows, they leave the young trees naked exposing them to the storm of the evening,

only to make them bear their fresh leaves in the summer.
